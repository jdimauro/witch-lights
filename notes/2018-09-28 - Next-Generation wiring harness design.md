Final generation Witch Lights would have:

1. High gauge, low-resistance full-length power harness wires pulled through fully assembled harness using best-friends cable snake and wooden dowel (and a true human friend willing to assist)
2. 3.3v PIR motion sensors at each end of Witch Lights
3. lathe-turned aluminum and wood  (Someday goal: recycle scrap from Alloy in solar smelter up in the clearing in the woods) 
4. Stands and stakes for free-standing installation - Ian
5.
