# Is too much. I sum up.

The last few months have been tumultuous. 



# Animation Test

Before Firefly 2018, I did a quick setup of the Witch Lights in my front yard. I meant to capture video of last year's 3.0 build animation code (which was still running on the Witch Lights production hardware), then upload the 4.0 animation code from this year. 

I have a great deal of footage of the development and testing of Witch Lights 4.0, but that's on my upstairs test rig. The physical arrangement of the LED strips in space changes the effect of the Witch Lights, and I wanted to capture that.
